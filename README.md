# Android Messagesâ„¢ Desktop <a href="#"><img src="resources/icons/48x48.png" alt="Android Messages Desktop logo" title="Android Messages Desktop logo" /></a> 

Run Android Messages as a desktop app, a la iMessage. For those of us that prefer not to have a browser tab always open for this sort of thing.

### Disclaimer: I have tested this with my Pixel on both macOS High Sierra and Windows 10. Normal functionality seems to work, but help testing and feedback is greatly appreciated!

Inspired by:

* [Google Play Music Desktop Player](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-)
* [a Reddit post on r/Android](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/8shv6q/web_messages/e106a8r/)

Based on:

* [electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate)

# Download
Head over to the [latest releases](https://github.com/chrisknepper/android-messages-desktop/releases/latest) page!
* For Mac, choose the **dmg**
* For Windows, choose the **exe**
* For Linux, choose either the **deb**, the **snap**, the **pacman**, or the **AppImage**. If you're using Arch or derivates of, it's also available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/android-messages-desktop/).

**Important note:** The Windows app binary isn't signed. This doesn't seem to be a big problem, but please report any issues you run into on Windows that may be related to signing.

**Important note 2:** We currently have builds for Windows and macOS, and Linux. I test releases on macOS, Windows 10, and Ubuntu Linux. I would love help testing on additional distros of Linux and other versions of Windows.

# Features
* System notifications when a text comes in
* Notification badges on macOS
* Spellchecking in ~50 languages
* Run in background on Windows / Linux / macOS
* Minimize to tray on Windows / Linux
* Menu bar support on macOS
* TBD...

# Spellchecking
Implemented via the amazing [`electron-hunspell`](https://github.com/kwonoj/electron-hunspell) library with dictionaries provided by the excellent [`dictionaries`](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries) project. Language files are downloaded when the app opens and the language used is based on the language set in your operating system. If you switch your system language and restart the app, the spellchecking should occur in the new language as long as it is in the [list of supported languages](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries#table-of-dictionaries).

# TODOs / Roadmap (rough order of priority):
- [x] Make sure it actually works (definitely works as of v0.1.0, done via [8068ed2](../../commit/8068ed2))
- [x] Release signed binaries for macOS (binaries are signed as of v0.0.2, done via [8492023](../../commit/8492023))
- [x] Make an icon (done via [df625ba](../../commit/df625ba))
- [x] Remove left-over code from electron-boilerplate (done via [4e7638a](../../commit/4e7638a))
- [ ] Correct tests
- [x] Release packages for Linux (done via [41ed205](../../commit/41ed205))
- [x] Handling updates (done via [625bf6d](../../commit/625bf6d))
- [x] Platform-specific UX enhancements (i.e. badges in macOS dock) (this specific enhancement is in as of v0.1.0, done via [8068ed2](../../commit/8068ed2)) **UX enhancements and features are now being worked on with issues submitted by users**
- [ ] Release signed binaries for Windows
- [ ] Make a website? (if it gets popular enough)
- [ ] Support customization/custom options a la Google Play Music Desktop Player?

# Development
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, then run the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/chrisknepper/android-messages-desktop.git
cd android-messages-desktop
npm install
npm start
```

## Starting the app in development mode
```
npm start
```

# Testing
Run all tests:
```
npm test
```

## Unit
```
npm run unit
```
Using [electron-mocha](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha) test runner with the [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/) assertion library. You can put your spec files wherever you want within the `src` directory, just name them with the `.spec.js` extension.

## End to end
```
npm run e2e
```
Using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/). This task will run all files in `e2e` directory with `.e2e.js` extension.

# Publishing a release:
1. Commit what you want to go in the release (including updates to README and CHANGELOG)
2. Run `npm version <type>` where `<type>` is either `major`, `minor`, or `patch` depending on the extent of your changes (this command increments the version in package.json and creates a git tag for the new version)
3. Run `git push`
4. Run `git push --tags`
5. Run `npm run release` (for this step to succeed, you must have a GitHub Personal Access Token with write access to this repository in your `PATH` as `GH_TOKEN`)
6. Go to GitHub and publish the release (which should be there as a draft), taking care to make the release name match the tag name including the "v"

Once the packaging process finished, the `dist` directory will contain your distributable file.

We use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to handle the packaging process. It has a lot of [customization options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration), which you can declare under `"build"` key in `package.json`.

# The icons
We use [png2icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/png2icons) to create Windows and Mac icons from the source PNG icon, which is located in [assets/android_messages_desktop_icon.png](assets/android_messages_desktop_icon.png). However, the Windows icon generated from this package seems to result in visual corruption on Windows 10, so I'm manually converting the PNG to a Windows icon with [icoconvert.com](http://icoconvert.com) for the time being.
