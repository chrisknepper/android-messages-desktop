# Android Messages™ Desktop ![master status](https://github.com/OrangeDrangon/android-messages-desktop/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)

Run Android Messages as a desktop app, a la iMessage. For those of us that prefer not to have a browser tab always open for this sort of thing.

# Download

Head over to the [latest releases](https://github.com/OrangeDrangon/android-messages-desktop/releases/latest) page!

**Important Note 1:** We currently have builds for Windows and macOS, and Linux. I test releases on Arch Linux and to a lesser degree Windows. I would love help testing in additional places.

**Important Note 2:** Neither the MacOS nor the Windows binaries are signed right now. I am willing to add this but I do not have the certificates required at this time.

# Install on MacOS via Homebrew

`brew install --cask orangedrangon-android-messages`
